# opay - Flutter 

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

connect your android device and run `flutter run`

Just trying to create a clone of this with `django` as `backend` bcus i am inspired with the Opay app after the first home page i see that their icons and assets are custom for this i can't view in their website then i decide to reverse one of their app going through the apps i am discourage and decided to stop this project i have discussed this in [Black Stack Hub Whatsapp Group](https://blackstackhub.com) i have only spend `two days` on this project and at night of the second day i make research and got discourage, below are few screenshots from the group chat

### Not interested again reason:

@talented_dev  not interested again ðŸ˜‚ jhare this app looks like opensource but not tell to the world, very vulnerable if bad guys have their time they will scam people freely that will look too legal, mostly opay.ng is fucking vulnerable like there're some other service you can use them as middle man self.

Not interested reasons:
1 time(limited)
2 too much pages
3 soft and wide(i expect hard)
4 webapp(i am using flutter)
5 anyone can do it (its easy)
6 too much API
7 version control
8 private(didn't tell unless u go in) Open Source(bcus everything has  API and no ONLY its ANYONE)


In below screenshot you will find my little search about anyone did Opay clone before then why not interested anymore and some other pains
